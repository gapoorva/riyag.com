Her decision wasn\'t sent out with the first wave of acceptances in late February, leaving her in limbo</p><p>Then, one night in Mid-March, Riya was away at an NHS volunteer event when an email arrived in her inbox. Although she forbid anyone from looking at it until after she came back home, Dad peeked anyway. The result brought Mom and Dad to tears - their daughter was admitted! Mom called Riya while she was volunteering and she couldn\'t believe what she heard. Letting a big weight off her conscience, she digested what this meant - she would be part of a vibrant community of students and professors and attend one of the best business schools in the country.</p>',

At Penn, Dad and Riya took a selfie outside of their Wharton School of Business.</p><p>The Penn visit was especially tiring, since their flight had been cancelled in Detroit and they made a last-minute road trip to Philadelphia just to make the tour. However in the end, it was all beneficial - Riya began to get the feeling that she liked Ann Arbor and the business school there. She decided to apply.</p>',

She often held him by the neck, so over time, his neck would just be limp as his head fell to one side. A favorite activity for Apoorva would be to hide Teddy in odd and obscure places, watching Riya frantically search for Teddy. Although the origins and the retirement of Teddy the giraffe have long been forgotten, he was honorably discharged from service in 2008.</p>',
